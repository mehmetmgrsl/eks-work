## 1. Why EKS?

- When you want to deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes without dealing with the complexity of maintaining the control plane then you can use EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service -> AWS managed service).

- It's beneficial when you need efficient scaling, high availability, seamless integration with AWS services, and enhanced security.
